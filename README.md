##Instructions
 Step 1: Donwload the [FMNIST](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zalando-research/fashionmnist) Dataset. 
 Step 2: Run init.c to assign random weights to model
 Step 3: Convert training labels to one-hot-encoding by running one_hot_encoding.c.
 Step 4: Run main.c to train the models on 60k pictures from the FMNIST Dataset.
 Step 5: Validate the Model by running test.c.
