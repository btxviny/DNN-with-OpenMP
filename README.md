##Instructions
1. Donwload the [FMNIST](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zalando-research/fashionmnist) Dataset. 
2. Run init.c to assign random weights to model
3. Convert training labels to one-hot-encoding by running one_hot_encoding.c.
4. Run main.c to train the network on 60k pictures from the FMNIST Dataset.
5. Validate the Model by running test.c.
