 Step 1: Donwload Dataset from LINK ## 
 Step 2: Run init.c to assign random weights to model ##
 Step 3: Convert training labels to one-hot-encoding by running one_hot_encoding.c ##
 Step 4: Run main.c to train the models on 60k pictures from the FMNIST Dataset ##
 Step 5: Validate the Model by running test.c ##
